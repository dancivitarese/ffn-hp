We're going to provide a comprehensive documentation ASAP.

## How to run

We have three main scripts that need to be executed in this order:

  1. `create_dataset`
  1. `train_model`
  1. `run_model`

### Creating the training dataset

```
python create_data.py
```

### Training your model

```
python train_model.py
```

### Running your model on the real seismic

```
python run_model.py
```
